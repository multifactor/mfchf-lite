The Multi-Factor Credential Hashing Function (MFCHF) is an experimental replacement for password hashing that uses multiple authentication factors to produce a single hash. Based on the multi-factor key derivation function (MFKDF). The mfchf-lite repository is a lightweight version of MFCHF that does not load the entire MFKDF library.

This repository is currently available for research purposes only, and has not been audited for use in production applications. Please see the main [MFKDF repository](https://github.com/multifactor/MFKDF) and [MFKDF website](https://mfkdf.com) for more information.
